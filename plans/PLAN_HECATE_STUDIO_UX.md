# PLAN: Hecate Studio UX

The Hecate TUI evolves from a simple monitoring tool into a full **Development Studio** for building Macula services.

## Vision

Three pillars:

1. **Social** — Browse the mesh community (agents, capabilities, reputation)
2. **Workflow** — AI-guided service development (Discover → Architect → Implement → Deploy)
3. **Coach** — Agent trainer with doctrine enforcement ("Hecate on the Node")

Plus: **Identity** — Profile, pairing status, settings.

---

## Navigation Structure

```
[1] Social     - Browse agents, capabilities, local vs remote services
[2] Discover   - Find gaps in the mesh, identify opportunities
[3] Architect  - Cartwheel scaffolding for new services
[4] Implement  - Guided coding with templates and AI assistance
[5] Deploy     - Pre-flight checks, announce to mesh
[6] Coach      - Agent training, doctrine enforcement, live monitoring
[7] Identity   - Profile, pairing, daemon status, settings
```

---

## 1. Social View

### Purpose
Browse the Hecate Social community — agents, capabilities, reputation.

### Sub-tabs
- **Local Services** — Capabilities I provide (my daemon)
- **Remote Services** — Capabilities discovered from mesh
- **Agents** — Browse agent profiles
- **Following** — Agents I follow

### Local vs Remote Distinction

| Aspect | Local Service | Remote Service |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Ownership | I own it | Someone else owns it |
| Actions | Edit, Pause, Deprecate | Test, Subscribe, Endorse, Report |
| Metrics | Full logs, detailed stats | Public reputation only |
| Config | Editable | Read-only |

### Local Service List
- Service name and MRI
- Status indicator (LIVE, PAUSED, ERROR)
- Calls today / total
- Star rating
- Quick actions: View, Pause, Edit

### Local Service Detail
- Identity: Agent MRI, registration date, procedure, tags
- Reputation: Stars, endorsements, disputes
- Metrics: Calls, latency (avg/p99), success rate, uptime
- Recent activity log
- Configuration (editable)
- Actions: Edit config, Pause, Deprecate, View logs

### Remote Service List

- Reputation: Stars, endorsements, disputes, total calls
- My interaction: Subscribed?, My calls, My rating, Endorsed?
- Test call input (JSON editor)
- Actions: Test, Subscribe, Rate, Endorse, Report

### Agent List
- Agent name and MRI
- Capability count
- Calls served
- Star rating
- Actions: View, Follow

### Agent Detail
- Profile info
- Capabilities provided
- Reputation summary
- Badges earned
- Actions: Follow, View capabilities

---

## 2. Discover View

### Purpose
AI-assisted gap analysis — find opportunities for new services.

### Flow
1. User describes what they want to build (free text input)
2. TUI queries mesh for related capabilities
3. AI analyzes gaps and opportunities
4. Presents recommendation

### Sections
- **Input**: Text field for service idea
- **Mesh Analysis**: Related capabilities found, their ratings and usage
- **Gap Analysis**: What's missing, opportunities identified
- **Recommendation**: Suggested service scope and differentiation

### Actions
- Continue to Architect (with context carried forward)
- Refine search
- View related capability details

---

## 3. Architect View

### Purpose
Generate Cartwheel Architecture scaffolding for the service.

### Context
Receives service concept from Discover (or manual entry).

### Sections
- **Service metadata**: Name, realm, description
- **Domain structure**: Visual tree of planned slices

### Domain Structure Display

```
service_name/
├── CMD SLICES (write path)
│   ├── command_one/
│   │   ├── command_one_v1.erl        (command)
│   │   ├── event_happened_v1.erl     (event)
│   │   ├── maybe_command_one.erl     (handler)
│   │   └── aggregate.erl             (aggregate)
│   └── command_two/
│       └── ...
├── QRY SLICES (read path)
│   ├── query_one/
│   │   └── query_one.erl             (queries projection)
│   └── query_two/
│       └── ...
├── PROJECTIONS
│   ├── projection_one.erl            (events → read model)
│   └── projection_two.erl
└── MESH INTEGRATION
    ├── fact_listener.erl             (FACT → CMD)
    ├── event_emitter.erl             (EVENT → FACT)
    └── rpc_responder.erl             (HOPE → CMD → FEEDBACK)
```

### Important
- CMD/QRY/PRJ are **domain slices** (business logic)
- LISTENER/EMITTER/RESPONDER are **mesh components** (infrastructure within domains)
- Listeners are NOT parallel to CMD slices — they live inside domains and feed into CMD slices

### Actions
- Generate scaffold (creates directory structure and boilerplate)
- Edit structure (add/remove slices)
- Explain pattern (AI explains Cartwheel concepts)

---

## 4. Implement View

### Purpose
Guided coding with templates, progress tracking, and AI assistance.

### Sections
- **Current file**: Which file is being worked on
- **Template pane**: Boilerplate code for current file type
- **Guidance pane**: Explanation of the pattern being implemented
- **Progress tracker**: Checklist of files in current slice

### File Types and Templates
- Command modules: `new/N`, `to_map/1`, `from_map/1`
- Event modules: Same pattern as commands
- Handler modules: `handle/1`, `dispatch/1`
- Aggregate modules: State management
- Query modules: `execute/N`
- Projection modules: Event handlers that update read models
- Listener modules: FACT → CMD dispatch
- Emitter modules: EVENT → FACT publish
- Responder modules: HOPE → CMD → FEEDBACK

### Actions
- Copy template to clipboard
- Next file in sequence
- Ask AI for help
- Run tests for current slice

---

## 5. Deploy View

### Purpose
Pre-flight checks and mesh deployment.

### Pre-flight Checks
- Compiles cleanly
- Dialyzer passes
- Tests pass
- No doctrine violations detected
- Event schemas versioned

### Capability Announcement Preview
- MRI to be announced
- Procedure name
- Tags
- Description

### Deployment Target
- Local daemon only
- Mesh realm (with realm selection)

### Actions
- Deploy now
- Preview announcement
- View logs

---

## 6. Coach View

### Purpose
Agent training, doctrine enforcement, live monitoring. "Hecate on the Node."

### Agent Selection
- Select which AI agent to coach (claude-code, etc.)
- Display session duration and correction count

### Doctrine Memory
Progress bar showing internalization level.

Per-doctrine status:
- Vertical slicing — correct applications count
- CMD/Event/Handler pattern — understanding level
- Spoke supervisors — learned/needs reinforcement
- FACTS ≠ EVENTS — status
- Horizontal temptation — violation count

### Live Monitor
Filesystem watcher on project directory.

Event log showing:
- Files/directories created
- Doctrine violations detected (with alerts)
- Timestamps

### Intervention System
When violation detected:
- Alert popup with explanation
- What the agent did wrong
- What they should do instead
- Actions: Send correction to agent, Delete offending file/dir, Dismiss

### History
- Session history
- Correction log
- Patterns of mistakes

### Memory Report
- Export agent's doctrine understanding
- Identify areas needing reinforcement

---

## 7. Identity View

### Purpose
Profile, pairing status, daemon health, settings.

### Sections

#### My Identity
- Agent MRI
- Display name
- Description (editable)
- Created date
- Public key fingerprint

#### Pairing Status
- Paired realm(s)
- Pairing date
- Certificate expiry
- Actions: Pair new realm, Unpair

#### Daemon Status
- Running/stopped
- Version
- Uptime
- Port
- Data directory
- Actions: Restart, View logs

#### Mesh Connection
- Connected/disconnected
- Bootstrap nodes
- Peers count
- Last sync

#### Settings
- Default realm
- Notification preferences
- Coach strictness level
- Theme (dark/light)

---

## Technical Notes

### State Management
Each view maintains its own state. Navigation preserves state within session.

### Data Sources
- **Local**: Daemon HTTP API at `:4444`
- **Remote**: Mesh queries via daemon
- **Coach**: Filesystem watcher + Git integration

### Keyboard Navigation
- Number keys (1-7) jump to views
- Tab cycles through panes
- Arrow keys navigate lists
- Enter selects/expands
- Esc goes back
- ? shows help

### Responsive Layout
- Minimum terminal size: 80x24
- Adapts to larger terminals
- Panes resize proportionally

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Navigation framework (7 tabs)
- Identity view (daemon status, basic profile)
- Social view — Local services list and detail

### Phase 2: Discovery
- Social view — Remote services list and detail
- Discover view — Gap analysis with AI

### Phase 3: Workflow
- Architect view — Cartwheel scaffolding
- Implement view — Templates and guidance

### Phase 4: Operations
- Deploy view — Pre-flight and deployment
- Social view — Full agent browsing

### Phase 5: Coach
- Coach view — Live monitoring
- Filesystem watcher integration
- Intervention system

---

## Design Principles

1. **Information density**: Show relevant data without clutter
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Summary → Detail on demand
3. **Keyboard-first**: Everything accessible via keyboard
4. **Offline-capable**: Core features work without mesh connection
5. **AI-assisted, not AI-dependent**: Guidance helps, but manual override always available

---

## Coach Architecture: Rules-First, AI-Optional

### Key Distinction

**Macula Agents/Services are NOT AI-powered.** They are traditional business process services — deterministic, testable, reliable. Weather forecasting, data aggregation, payment processing, whatever. No LLM in the runtime.

**LLMs are development tools**, not runtime dependencies. We use AI to:
- Generate code scaffolding
- Write documentation
- Create SVG diagrams
- Explain architecture concepts

The services themselves are pure business logic.

### Two Concerns, Two Approaches

**1. Doctrine Enforcement (Coach)** — Rules-based, no LLM:

| Function | Implementation | LLM Required |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Detect violations | Pattern matching on paths/content | No |
| Identify `services/`, `helpers/`, `utils/` | Regex on directory names | No |
| Catch central supervisors | AST analysis or naming patterns | No |
| Generate correction message | Templated responses | No |

**2. Code Generation (Architect/Implement)** — LLM required, core feature:

| Function | Implementation | LLM Required |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Cartwheel code scaffolding | Model generates slice code | **Yes** |
| Documentation generation | Model writes docs | **Yes** |
| Architecture guidance | Model explains concepts | **Yes** |
| SVG diagram generation | Model creates visuals | **Yes** |

Code generation is THE value proposition of Hecate Studio. This requires model configuration.

### Rules Engine Implementation (Go)

The Coach is implemented in Go using filesystem watching and pattern matching.

**Dependencies:**
- `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` — filesystem watcher

**Core types:**

```go
type Rule struct {
    ID       string
    Name     string
    Pattern  Pattern      // interface
    Severity Severity     // Info, Warning, Error
    Message  string       // template with {{.Path}}, {{.Filename}}
}

type Pattern interface {
    Match(path string, content []byte) bool
}

type PathPattern struct {
    Regex *regexp.Regexp
}

type ContentPattern struct {
    Regex     *regexp.Regexp
    FileTypes []string  // e.g., [".erl", ".ex"]
}
```

**Built-in Cartwheel rules:**

```go
var CartwheelRules = []Rule{
    {
        ID:       "horizontal-services",
        Pattern:  PathPattern{Regex: regexp.MustCompile(`/services/`)},
        Severity: Error,
        Message:  "Horizontal directory 'services/' detected at {{.Path}}. Each service belongs to its domain.",
    },
    {
        ID:       "horizontal-helpers",
        Pattern:  PathPattern{Regex: regexp.MustCompile(`/helpers/`)},
        Severity: Error,
        Message:  "Horizontal directory 'helpers/' detected. Move to the domain that owns it.",
    },
    {
        ID:       "horizontal-utils",
        Pattern:  PathPattern{Regex: regexp.MustCompile(`/utils/`)},
        Severity: Error,
        Message:  "Horizontal directory 'utils/' detected. Make it a library app or put it in the feature.",
    },
    {
        ID:       "central-supervisor",
        Pattern:  PathPattern{Regex: regexp.MustCompile(`_(listeners|handlers|workers)_sup\.erl$`)},
        Severity: Error,
        Message:  "Central supervisor '{{.Filename}}' detected. Each domain supervises its own.",
    },
    {
        ID:       "crud-event",
        Pattern:  ContentPattern{
            Regex:     regexp.MustCompile(`_(created|updated|deleted)_v\d+`),
            FileTypes: []string{".erl"},
        },
        Severity: Warning,
        Message:  "CRUD event name detected. Use business-meaningful names.",
    },
    {
        ID:       "god-module",
        Pattern:  PathPattern{Regex: regexp.MustCompile(`_manager\.erl$`)},
        Severity: Warning,
        Message:  "Possible god module '*_manager'. Does one domain own this?",
    },
}
```

**Coach engine:**

```go
type Coach struct {
    watcher  *fsnotify.Watcher
    rules    []Rule
    alerts   chan Alert
    project  string
}

func (c *Coach) Watch(projectDir string) error {
    // Add recursive watch on project directory
    // For each fsnotify.Create or fsnotify.Write event:
    //   - Read file content (for content rules)
    //   - Evaluate all rules against path and content
    //   - Emit Alert to channel if any rule matches
}

func (c *Coach) Evaluate(event fsnotify.Event) {
    path := event.Name
    content, _ := os.ReadFile(path)
    
    for _, rule := range c.rules {
        if rule.Pattern.Match(path, content) {
            c.alerts <- Alert{
                Rule:     rule,
                Path:     path,
                Filename: filepath.Base(path),
                Time:     time.Now(),
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**TUI integration:**

```go
// Coach runs as background goroutine
func (m Model) Init() tea.Cmd {
    go m.coach.Watch(m.projectDir)
    return pollAlerts(m.coach)
}

// Poll alerts channel
func pollAlerts(coach *Coach) tea.Cmd {
    return func() tea.Msg {
        alert := <-coach.alerts
        return AlertMsg{Alert: alert}
    }
}

// Update handles alerts
func (m Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    switch msg := msg.(type) {
    case AlertMsg:
        m.alerts = append(m.alerts, msg.Alert)
        return m, pollAlerts(m.coach)  // continue polling
    }
    return m, nil
}
```

**User-defined rules (config):**

```toml
# ~/.hecate/coach.toml

[[rules]]
id = "no-nested-case"
type = "content"
regex = "case.*of[\\s\\S]*case.*of"
file_types = [".erl"]
severity = "warning"
message = "Nested case statements detected. Consider pattern matching on function heads."

[[rules]]
id = "custom-horizontal"
type = "path"
regex = "/shared/"
severity = "error"
message = "Directory 'shared/' is horizontal. Put code in the owning domain."
```

No LLM needed. Pure Go, pattern matching, works offline.

### Model Configuration (Required for Studio)

Code generation is a core feature. Users must configure a model provider:

**Supported providers:**
- Ollama (local, free, recommended for privacy)
- Anthropic API (Claude)
- OpenAI API (GPT)
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

**Configuration:**
```
~/.hecate/config.toml

[studio]
provider = "ollama"  # or "anthropic", "openai"
model = "llama3:8b"  # or "claude-3-sonnet", "gpt-4", etc.
endpoint = "http://localhost:11434"  # for Ollama
# api_key = "..." (for cloud providers)
```

**First-run experience:**
If no model configured, Studio prompts user to set up:
1. Detect if Ollama is running locally
2. Offer to configure Ollama (easiest path)
3. Or enter API key for cloud provider

### Model Requirements

| Task | Minimum Model | Recommended |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Code scaffolding | Llama 3 8B | Llama 3 70B, Claude Sonnet |
| Documentation | Llama 3 8B | Any capable model |
| Architecture Q&A | Llama 3 8B | Larger context helps |
| SVG generation | Llama 3 8B | Claude preferred |

Local 8B models work. Larger models produce better results.

### Summary

- **Macula Services**: Pure business logic, no AI runtime
- **Doctrine enforcement (Coach)**: Rules engine, no LLM needed
- **Code generation (Studio)**: LLM required, user configures provider
- **Daemon**: Stays lean, no bundled model

The Studio is an AI-powered development tool. The services it produces are not.
