## Context

The TUI is evolving from a monitoring tool into **Hecate Studio** — a full development environment for building Macula services.

**Read the plan:** `plans/PLAN_HECATE_STUDIO_UX.md`

This defines seven views:
1. Social — Local/Remote services, agents
2. Discover — AI-assisted gap analysis
3. Architect — Cartwheel scaffolding
4. Implement — Guided coding
5. Deploy — Pre-flight and mesh deployment
6. Coach — Agent training, doctrine enforcement
7. Identity — Profile, pairing, daemon status, settings

---

## Active Tasks

### HIGH: Review PLAN_HECATE_STUDIO_UX.md

Read the plan carefully. Understand the vision.

Report in RESPONSES.md:
- Questions or clarifications needed
- Technical concerns
- Suggested changes

### MEDIUM: Assess Current State

Compare current TUI implementation against the plan.

What exists? What's missing? What needs refactoring?

Create a gap analysis in RESPONSES.md.

### LOW: Propose Phase 1 Implementation

Based on the plan's Phase 1 (Foundation):
- Navigation framework (7 tabs)
- Identity view (daemon status, basic profile)
- Social view — Local services list and detail

Propose specific implementation steps.
